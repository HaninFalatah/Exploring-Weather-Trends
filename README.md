# Exploring Weather Trends
I analyzed the local and global temperature data to compare the temperature trends of where I live to overall global temperature trends.
"The City I analayed the weather trends of Macca comparing to the global weather trends"

## The Goal 
The goal is creating a visualization and from it describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in my city or the closest big city to where you live.

  - Export the temperature data for the world and for the your city or the closest big city to where you live.
    the Cities and countries are found in  the city_list table.
    To interact with the database, by write a SQL query. then Open the CSV file in Excel.

     - that compares the cityâ€™s temperatures with the globally temperatures.
	  - that of the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to making trends more observable.
-	Write your observations about the similarities and differences between the globally temperatures averages and the city temperatures averages, and then the overall trends.
